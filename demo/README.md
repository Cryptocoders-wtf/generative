# Demo Script

Traditional NFT exchanges, such as OpenSea have three major issues.

1. The user needs to "trust" it -- very unlike Web3.
2. setAsetApprovalForAll is a major security flaw of ERC271.
3. There is no way to enforce creator royalties.

We came up with an extention to ERC271, ERC271P2P, which addresses those issues.
It enables trustless transactions between users, while enforcing the creator roalities at the contract level. 

We've created the very first instance of NFT. Here is the demo.

1. Open nft.fullyonchain.xyz
2. Drag & Drop, Ethereum logo onto it.
3. Specify the price (0.5ETH) and mint.
4. After the completion, explain that we can share via SNS.
5. Switch the wallet. Show that the "Purchase" button.
6. Click "Purchase"
